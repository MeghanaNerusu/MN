Business Problem and objective:

The key challenge for Home Credit is to maximize their loan approval process by accurately identifying customers with a high likelihood of repaying their loans on time. This will require developing an efficient and accurate predictive model that can assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.Home Credit's aim is to leverage machine learning and data analysis to develop a robust predictive model that accurately identifies reliable borrowers, maximizing loan approvals and minimizing rejections. This will reduce the risk of defaults, improve profitability, and enhance overall customer satisfaction by increasing access to financial services.

Solution to the Business Problem:

To create a robust and reliable model, the group carefully selected and analyzed an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. The selected algorithms include Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors, each bringing its strengths to the table.cRidge Regression and XGBoost were particularly notable for their outstanding performance in the context of this problem with 0.64%. Ridge Regression is adept at handling multicollinearity, a situation where independent variables are highly correlated, ensuring that the model remains stable and accurate despite such correlations. XGBoost, on the other hand, excels in capturing complex interactions between variables, enabling it to uncover subtle patterns and relationships within the data. As a gradient boosting algorithm, it builds multiple weak learners in an ensemble, combining their predictions to create a more accurate and powerful model. The combined strengths of Ridge Regression and XGBoost, along with the other carefully selected algorithms, provide a comprehensive approach to credit risk assessment.When running the new models on the same new data in the Kaggle competition we received the following score. The majority class was 50%, the Ensemble model trained solely on the application data was 70.3, and the Ensemble model trained on the combined dataset was 71.6%. 

Contribution to the Project:

Throughout the group project, my contributions were essential in both the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the modeling stages. In the EDA phase, I took a lead role in thoroughly exploring and analyzing datasets such as bureau, previous application, and application data. I actively participated in data aggregation and integration processes to extract meaningful insights.
During the modeling stage, I focused on implementing the SVC (Support Vector Classification) model. I fine-tuned the model parameters and performed feature engineering to optimize its predictive performance. This involved selecting relevant features and transforming them to improve the model's accuracy.

Business Value of the Solution:

The solution brings substantial business value to Home Credit, offering improved risk management, enhanced customer experience, increased operational efficiency, expanded market opportunities, and lower default rates. The predictive model empowers the company with data-driven insights, enabling better lending decisions and fostering long-term business success. By making more informed decisions, Home Credit can reduce potential financial risks and achieve improved overall business performance. The predictive model is a valuable tool that equips Home Credit with the ability to navigate the lending landscape more effectively and optimize their operations for continued growth and success.

Difficulties that our group encountered along the way:

Our group encountered challenges while combining datasets to develop a predictive model for creditworthiness assessment. Data compatibility issues, such as varying data types and formats, required extensive preprocessing and standardization efforts to ensure smooth integration. Additionally, handling missing data posed a significant hurdle, and we had to carefully decide on suitable approaches for imputation or exclusion. Despite these difficulties, our collaborative efforts allowed us to overcome these obstacles successfully.

Learnings in the project :

The process of building the loan default prediction model provided valuable lessons in handling complex datasets, addressing class imbalances, and conducting feature engineering. Additionally, we learned about data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation metrics, ensemble methods, cross-validation, interpretability techniques, and business impact analysis. These insights will guide our future endeavors, enhancing our ability to apply data science and machine learning effectively to diverse business challenges.
